    <h1>Welcome David Nemeth Programming test</h1>

    <p>
        Thank you to give a chance to me prove my skills. Looks like I tried to bite bigger as I can chew and a day was not enough to pick up the missing seven years in Laravel.<br/>
        Even if you not pick me, I really enjoyed the challenge, it was good to relearn Laravel usage. Possible with a bit more preparation time I can do a much better result.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this coding exercise I nailed every task, but I have some parts where I not happy with the result.
        <ul>
            <li>I resized the image, but I wished to crop so I don't distorter the image ( I already find a library, but had no time to update) </li>
            <li>Some reason I was not able the use the proper linking the datatable JS and CSS so after half hour try, I just directly linked. (I'm sure a front end developer find my error in 10 min)</li>
            <li>Planned view page, but had no time.</li>
            <li>Possibly better PHP Documentation. Again time shortage</li>
        </ul>

    On top of this of course have a lot of other part, which I can improve especially frontend wise, which I didn't focused too much.

    <br/>
    <strong>Total time I spent on the project: 4h37m</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Thank you your time.</p>
